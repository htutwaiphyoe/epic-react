# React Fundamentals

## 01. Basic JavaScript-rendered Hello World

The browser takes html, generates DOM and exposes it to JavaScript to add
interactivity of web page.

In traditional way, web page (html) are generated by the server and add
JavaScript on top of generated html for interactivity. But the requirements of
interactivity become more challenging, this approach is default to maintain and
have performance issues. That's why modern javascript library are created to
create DOM programmatically rather than defining in html.

[DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)

## 02. Introduction to Raw React API

[react source code](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/48907797294340b6d5d8fecfbcf97edf0691888d/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMComponent.js#L416)

React abstracts the imperative browser API and gives a much declarative API

[imperative vs declarative](https://ui.dev/imperative-vs-declarative-programming)

React supports multiple platforms and each one has its own code and shared code
between platforms.

For web applications, two JavaScript files is needed.

1. React => responsible for creating React elements (like
   document.createElement())
2. ReactDOM => responsible for rendering React elements to the DOM
   (rootElement.append())

To get React and ReactDOM library, use npm (package registry) or cdn (unpkg.com)

[unpkg](https://unpkg.com/)

after including script tags, React and ReactDOM are available as global
variables due to UMD (universal module definition)

In React.createElement, children can be properties of prop object or any number
of additional parameters which is after second parameter. So, for multiple
children, can use array or multiple parameters. if children is array, key is
needed to provide, multiple parameters, no need to provide. if no props is
needed, can give null

## Using JSX

JSX is html-like syntactic sugar on top of raw React API. It is easy to read,
write and understand. It compiles to React raw api.

JSX is not actually JavaScript, need to be used babel compiler, check in babel
REPL for example

[babel](https://babeljs.io/)

[babel repl for jsx](https://babeljs.io/repl#?browsers=defaults%2C%20not%20ie%2011%2C%20not%20ie_mob%2011&build=&builtIns=App&corejs=3.21&spec=false&loose=false&code_lz=MYewdgzgLgBArgSxgXhgHgCYIG4D40QAOAhmLgBICmANtSGgPRGm7rNkDqIATtRo-3wMseAFBA&debug=false&forceAllTransforms=false&shippedProposals=false&circleciRepo=&evaluate=false&fileSize=false&timeTravel=false&sourceType=module&lineWrap=true&presets=react&prettier=true&targets=&version=7.17.11&externalPlugins=&assumptions=%7B%7D)

Knowing JSX and its compiled version is good for reading and using it.

since jsx also is not actually html, there are a few subtle differences for
attributes. For eg, class in html, className in JSX

[jsx vs html attributes](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#differences-in-attributes)

Interpolation is defined as "the insertion of something of a different nature
into something else." Interpolation only accepts expressions.

[jsx](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

if children are provided in props and children, it will show only one. if
children are provided in props, it will be in props of React.createElement if
children are provided in children, it will be third parameter of
React.createElement

text/babel means browser does not run that script but babel takes that and
compiles and generates new script tag in the head tag which can be run by
browser

for passing props, order of props matters because of overwriting. Same props can
be overwritten by latter.

[spread props](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#spread-attributes)

## Creating custom components

To share and reuse JSX, functions are used. These functions are called
"components" and they have special properties.

Components are basically functions which return something that can render (React
elements, strings, null, numbers, etc.)

Reusing means reducing code duplication.

[jsx in depth](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)
[what is jsx](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/what-is-jsx)

The first argument to React.createElement can also be a function which returns
something that can be rendered. It takes the function as the type

React.createElement(type, props, children)

The difference between React.createElement and regular function call is in the
React dev tool React.createElement creates component for the function but
regular function call does not.

```js

ui = <Capitalized /> // React.createElement(Capitalized)
ui = <property.access /> // React.createElement(property.access)
ui = <Property.Access /> // React.createElement(Property.Access)
ui = <Property['Access'] /> // SyntaxError
ui = <lowercase /> // React.createElement('lowercase')
ui = <kebab-case /> // React.createElement('kebab-case')
ui = <Upper-Kebab-Case /> // React.createElement('Upper-Kebab-Case')
ui = <Upper_Snake_Case /> // React.createElement(Upper_Snake_Case)
ui = <lower_snake_case /> // React.createElement('lower_snake_case')

```

To use functions as custom components, need to define function name to
Capitalized for babel to passes the function as a reference rather than a string
of its name

if capital letter in jsx, it is the reference in its scope.

what if prop is a string but a number is provided or prop is not provided, to
check and validate, PropTypes is used. It will show some indications for props
which are not passed correct values. PropTypes run for each props for a
component (function), it will be slow performance, so in production, it will be
dropped

[typechecking with proptypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html)

React team create a package of prop-types.

[npm proptypes](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types)

jsx element must have one parent element but if you don't wanna add use
React.Fragment or <> can be used to render elements side by side without nesting
under root element.

## Styling

Two ways to style react components

1. Inline style with style prop
2. Regular CSS with className prop

Inline style

In html => string of css, kebab-cased notation

In react => object of css, camelCased notation

style property of DOM nodes => CSSStyleDeclaration

class property of DOM nodes => className

html attributes and dom properties are not the same.

JSX follows property name of DOM node.

DOM property means dom element property like
document.getElementById('item').classList, style, className

[CSSStyleDeclaration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration)

[dom properties](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_all.asp)

To avoid undefined, set default value to property

the user of component should pass props which are not depend on implementation
details of component.

it is program to interface, not implementation
