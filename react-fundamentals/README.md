# React Fundamentals

## 01. Basic JavaScript-rendered Hello World

The browser takes html, generates DOM and exposes it to JavaScript to add
interactivity of web page.

In traditional way, web page (html) are generated by the server and add
JavaScript on top of generated html for interactivity. But the requirements of
interactivity become more challenging, this approach is default to maintain and
have performance issues. That's why modern javascript library are created to
create DOM programmatically rather than defining in html.
