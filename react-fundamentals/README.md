# React Fundamentals

## 01. Basic JavaScript-rendered Hello World

The browser takes html, generates DOM and exposes it to JavaScript to add
interactivity of web page.

In traditional way, web page (html) are generated by the server and add
JavaScript on top of generated html for interactivity. But the requirements of
interactivity become more challenging, this approach is default to maintain and
have performance issues. That's why modern javascript library are created to
create DOM programmatically rather than defining in html.

## 02. Introduction to Raw React API

[react source code](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/48907797294340b6d5d8fecfbcf97edf0691888d/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMComponent.js#L416)

React abstracts the imperative browser API and gives a much declarative API

[imperative vs declarative](https://ui.dev/imperative-vs-declarative-programming)

React supports multiple platforms and each one has its own code and shared code
between platforms.

For web applications, two JavaScript files is needed.

1. React => responsible for creating React elements (like
   document.createElement())
2. ReactDOM => responsible for rendering React elements to the DOM
   (rootElement.append())

To get React and ReactDOM library, use npm (package registry) or cdn (unpkg.com)

[unpkg](https://unpkg.com/)

after including script tags, React and ReactDOM are available as global
variables due to UMD (universal module definition)

In React.createElement, children can be properties of prop object or any number
of additional parameters which is after second parameter. So, for multiple
children, can use array or multiple parameters. if children is array, key is
needed to provide, multiple parameters, no need to provide. if no props is
needed, can give null
